This article contains post-release financial results, thoughts, plans and assorted data for SNKRX.
I'm writing this mostly for my own future reference, especially the comparisons with BYTEPATH, since it's useful to see how differently
these games are performing despite being released under very similar conditions.

This article is also being updated over time and continues from the "financial results" section of the [lessons learned article](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/lessons_second_game/).

## Day 3

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1283 | $2634 | 1238 |
| SNKRX | 601 | $1429 | 788 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/DqacCqa.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/7oj64lE.png" >}}

Based on these numbers the updated projection for SNKRX's performance is that it will do about half as well as BYTEPATH, which is an improvement from 1/3rd as well.
This improves it from $4K over 3 years to $6K over 3 years, which is equivalent to about R$15K rather than R$10K.

## Day 7

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1534 | $3129 | 1585 |
| SNKRX | 1064 | $2534 | 1131 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/xG0KH6q.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/bvLwbuG.png" >}}

Now SNKRX is doing about 0.8 as well as BYTEPATH, which makes it go to ~10K over 3 years, equivalent to R$25K. This is significantly better than what it started with on day 1.
I have no idea why the game keeps improving in performance.

Yesterday it got a fairly good [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27254177) but that only improved its performance for that day by about 2X, which is not a lot.
This HN post was similar in views to the most popular [social media post for BYTEPATH](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7zu9vz/i_made_a_small_game_inspired_by_poes_passive/) (about 30K total views),
but it didn't generate nearly as many sales because it wasn't so focused on the specific audience the game is made for and it also links to a GitHub page rather than the Steam page.

So to answer the question of why the game is improving it's probably a good idea to check where visits to the store page are coming from and compare:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/VR6rID2.png" >}}

Here it's visible that in the first week BYTEPATH had a sizable number of visits from "external website", and most of that was from reddit.
SNKRX on the other hand had very few popular social media posts, and most of its visits seem to come from the discovery queue.

Why is it being shown a lot in the discovery queue? I have no idea. Either way, these are good week one stats.

## Day 13

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1696 | $3456| 1812 |
| SNKRX | 2011 | $5195 | 1941 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/rSz0lok.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/Ns6wXoV.png" >}}

SNKRX is now doing 1.5 times as well as BYTEPATH, making it go to about $18K over 3 years, equivalent to R$45K. Compared to my day 1 projections, which were at R$10K over 3 years, this is a very significant improvement.
The game is now doing WAY beyond any expectations I ever had for it and it's safely a huge success for me personally.

Now, many things happened since day 7 which helped contribute to this improvement, and it's worth going over them one by one.

### South Korea

Before that, though, I forgot to mention in the previous days that the game saw a pretty big response to it from South Korea. Here's what the country distribution looked like on day 3:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/Jh0n4zj.png" >}}

This happened because a streamer named [cbrace](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1027842952) played it and seemed to have a fairly good time.
Like most streamers who end up playing it, he played it for like 4 hours in one sitting, which is fairly good. I have no idea where this streamer found the game, but he did find it
fairly early (day 1 or 2), so either it was from one of my reddit posts or he just checks new releases on Steam frequently.

It's also worth noting that this streamer seems to have about ~500 average viewers, which isn't small but also isn't super huge. But he seems somewhat focused on roguelites, which makes
it so that his audience will end up buying the game at a way higher rate than they would if a more general streamer with more viewers played it.

### jwaaaap + Derek Yu

One day after the [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27254177), both [jwaaaap](https://twitter.com/jwaaaap) and [Derek Yu](https://twitter.com/mossmouth) recommended the game to their followers.
I don't know where they heard about the game, I can assume either twitter, the [lessons learned](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/lessons_second_game/) post I wrote, or something else. Either way, their recommendations directly led to:

### Streamers

[Esty8nine](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1035792120) picked up the game because of jwaaaap's recommendation and he really seemed to enjoy it.
After that [Dan Gheesling](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1036906438) played it due to Derek's recommendation and he really seemed to like it as well.

[SLEEPCYCLES](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1037913794) was next and he seemed to like it too. Then [Wanderbot](https://www.twitch.tv/wanderbot/video/1039641591),
who also seemed to like it but had [an unfortunate end](https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileClumsyYamDoritosChip-vhaxrTS8FDE3meNz) to his play session due to a design oversight on my end.
And finally [Celerity](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1040040791) who played it today (day 14), and who also seemed to enjoy it due to how long he played it for.

Most (or all) of these streamers have audiences that are pretty focused on roguelites so the effect that they have on play numbers is pretty noticeable:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/8PGepqB.png" >}}

From May 17th to May 26th the game didn't really get played by any sizable streamers other than the Korean one, so the game's numbers are pretty flat, at around ~20 players consistently.
By itself this is still pretty good, because it means that people aren't dropping the game as fast as I thought they would.

But then you start adding streamers into the equation and you start getting these spikes in both concurrent players and purchases that you can see after May 26th. These 2 spikes at the end
that happened today (May 30th) are both from Celerity and from [Retromation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxd52qyULE) who released this video right as I'm writing this post.

These are very good numbers that I didn't expect at all and it's honestly kind of weird that people are responding to the game this positively.
Before release both SNKRX and BYTEPATH had a really hard time getting any traction at all, both games released with 200 wishlists only, and for both of them most
playtesters didn't seem to really enjoy the game that much.

But then after release both of them saw some version of success that was way better than the response before the game was released. This likely means that for these games I'm making
that don't really have good graphics, all they have to rely on for marketing is people actually playing and enjoying them. So my previous strategy of going for a playable demo
was likely right in this sense, although releasing an early broken demo is probably still not a good idea.

Either way, these are really good week two results.

### Reviews

As a very sort of off-topic aside, despite the increase in raw numbers of players, there was not a correspondent increase in number of reviews or bug reports. Until streamers started playing it
the increase in reviews and forum usage was pretty consistent with the increase in purchases, but after streamers that relationship was broken completely.

This is probably due to the fact that before streamers, most people buying the game were coming from the discovery queue, as mentioned in the post from the previous days. People using the discovery
queue are likely more used to using Steam features in general, and so they'll probably also review games and use the forums more frequently. Whereas people who are coming to the game from streamers are probably less accustomed
to leaving reviews or even using the forums for bug reports.

This has no implications on anything other than the fact that when trying to estimate sales based on review numbers I can probably get a better guess based on where most of the audience for the game is coming from.
If it's mostly coming from streamers then it's probably wise to increase multiplier.

### Future

Now, one of the things I've been thinking a lot about these past few days is if I should keep updating the game or not. This game has performed way beyond my expectations so far and it seems like people really enjoy
playing it quite a lot more than I imagined.

On my lessons learned post I wrote that I thought SNKRX failed when it came to making a long game, that is, a game that lasts the player a long time. I think this assessment was both right and wrong. 

At its core SNKRX lacks any ability to keep people playing it for hundreds of hours, there's just not enough content and the game also isn't structured to support that kind of length.
On the other hand, the game's basic mechanics - building your snake and moving it around trying to not die - seems to be better at keeping people playing than I anticipated.

There's some clear evidence for the game's long potential based on daily player numbers too, especially compared to BYTEPATH:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/7bOPGzs.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/BfTOUic.png" >}}

BYTEPATH had a fairly strong start but no retention at all, whereas SNKRX had a fairly weak start comparatively but seems to be retaining people a lot better.

Given that the failures of SNKRX in terms of its long potential are mostly due to content and structure, it seems like a good idea to try to fix that before moving on to the next game.
My idea is that adding a more traditional roguelite structure to it, probably something like Slay the Spire, would really improve the game. Adding some content updates (more units, classes, enemies, bosses, etc)
on top of that and a few more general QoL improvements that the game needs, and it would be in a really good spot.

I really wanted to just move on to another game but I know myself well enough to know that I'll regret not improving this game in these ways and seeing where it goes. I can probably add everything
I want in like 2 months, so even if nothing comes out of it it's still a fairly small amount of time "wasted" all things considered.

So this is what I'm probably going to do next and sadly this means that my "a game every 2 months" plan, as well as my engine refactor, have to be put on hold for a little while >.<
