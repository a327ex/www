This article contains post-release financial results, thoughts, plans and assorted data for SNKRX.
I'm writing this mostly for my own future reference, especially the comparisons with BYTEPATH, since it's useful to see how differently
these games are performing despite being released under very similar conditions.

<!--more-->

This article is also being updated over time and continues from the "financial results" section of the [lessons learned article](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/lessons_second_game/).

## Day 3 (21/05/19)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1283 | $2634 | 1238 |
| SNKRX | 601 | $1429 | 788 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/DqacCqa.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/7oj64lE.png" >}}

Based on these numbers the updated projection for SNKRX's performance is that it will do about half as well as BYTEPATH, which is an improvement from 1/3rd as well.
This improves it from $4K over 3 years to $6K over 3 years, which is equivalent to about R$15K rather than R$10K.

## Day 7 (21/05/23)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1534 | $3129 | 1585 |
| SNKRX | 1064 | $2534 | 1131 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/xG0KH6q.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/bvLwbuG.png" >}}

Now SNKRX is doing about 0.8 as well as BYTEPATH, which makes it go to ~10K over 3 years, equivalent to R$25K. This is significantly better than what it started with on day 1.
I have no idea why the game keeps improving in performance.

Yesterday it got a fairly good [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27254177) but that only improved its performance for that day by about 2X, which is not a lot.
This HN post was similar in views to the most popular [social media post for BYTEPATH](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7zu9vz/i_made_a_small_game_inspired_by_poes_passive/) (about 30K total views),
but it didn't generate nearly as many sales because it wasn't so focused on the specific audience the game is made for and it also links to a GitHub page rather than the Steam page.

So to answer the question of why the game is improving it's probably a good idea to check where visits to the store page are coming from and compare:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/j6GEzzQ.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/VR6rID2.png" >}}

Here it's visible that in the first week BYTEPATH had a sizable number of visits from "external website", and most of that was from reddit.
SNKRX on the other hand had very few popular social media posts, and most of its visits seem to come from the discovery queue.

Why is it being shown a lot in the discovery queue? I have no idea. Either way, these are good week one stats.

## Day 14 (21/05/30)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1712 | $3488 | 1839 |
| SNKRX | 2607 | $6944 | 2228 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/fa1HlC9.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/0t8vYT5.png" >}}

SNKRX is now doing 2 times as well as BYTEPATH, making it go to about $24K over 3 years, equivalent to R$60K. Compared to my day 1 projections, which were at R$10K over 3 years, this is a very significant improvement.
The game is now doing WAY beyond any expectations I ever had for it and it's safely a huge success for me personally.

Now, many things happened since day 7 which helped contribute to this improvement, and it's worth going over them one by one.

### South Korea

Before that, though, I forgot to mention in the previous days that the game saw a pretty big response to it from South Korea. Here's what the country distribution looked like on day 3:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/Jh0n4zj.png" >}}

This happened because a streamer named [cbrace](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1027842952) played it and seemed to have a fairly good time.
Like most streamers who end up playing it, he played it for like 4 hours in one sitting, which is fairly good. I have no idea where this streamer found the game, but he did find it
fairly early (day 1 or 2), so either it was from one of my reddit posts or he just checks new releases on Steam frequently.

It's also worth noting that this streamer seems to have about ~500 average viewers, which isn't small but also isn't super huge. But he seems somewhat focused on roguelites, which makes
it so that his audience will end up buying the game at a way higher rate than they would if a more general streamer with more viewers played it.

### jwaaaap + Derek Yu

One day after the [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27254177), both [jwaaaap](https://twitter.com/jwaaaap) and [Derek Yu](https://twitter.com/mossmouth) recommended the game to their followers.
I don't know where they heard about the game, I can assume either twitter, the [lessons learned](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/lessons_second_game/) post I wrote, or something else. Either way, their recommendations directly led to:

### Streamers

[Esty8nine](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1035792120) picked up the game because of jwaaaap's recommendation and he really seemed to enjoy it.
After that [Dan Gheesling](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1036906438) played it due to Derek's recommendation and he really seemed to like it as well.

[SLEEPCYCLES](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1037913794) was next and he seemed to like it too. Then [Wanderbot](https://www.twitch.tv/wanderbot/video/1039641591),
who also seemed to like it but had [an unfortunate end](https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileClumsyYamDoritosChip-vhaxrTS8FDE3meNz) to his play session due to a design oversight on my end.
And finally [Celerity](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1040040791) who played it yesterday, and who also seemed to enjoy it due to how long he played it for.

{{< hint info >}}
If you're reading this in the future and the links above are all broken, they're just links to the Twitch VODs of each streamer playing the game.
Twitch VODs get deleted automatically after a certain time.
{{< /hint >}}

All of these streamers have audiences that are pretty focused on roguelites so the effect that they have on play numbers is pretty noticeable:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/3rrihSw.png" >}}

From May 17th to May 26th the game didn't really get played by any sizable streamers other than the Korean one, so the game's numbers are pretty flat, at around ~20 players consistently.
By itself this is still pretty good, because it means that people aren't dropping the game as fast as I thought they would.
But then you start adding streamers into the equation and you start getting these spikes in both concurrent players and purchases that you can see after May 26th.

### YouTube

This very big and slowly decaying rise at the end (May 30th) comes from [Retromation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxd52qyULE) who released this video yesterday and drove quite a lot of sales to the game,
making it the best performing day for it so far.

It's also worth noting that Retromation is the first big YouTuber that played the game, and it makes sense that when a YouTuber with a suitable audience
plays it it leads to a more constant improvement in numbers as compared to streamers, which seem to mostly lead to an improvement only when they're streaming the game.

Based on a quick look on Retromation's channel, it seems that the videos perform better whenever it's the first upload for a new game, and then they slowly
decay over time if more videos are made about the same game. So this was likely the best boost in sales the game will get out of this particular YouTuber, and I wonder if this
relationship holds for any other YouTubers that end up making videos on the game as well.

Thinking about it this makes sense too, since people will check out the first video to see what the game is about and then a portion
will not watch any further videos on that game if they don't like it.

In any case, these are very good numbers that I didn't expect at all and it's honestly kind of weird that people are responding to the game this positively.
Before release both SNKRX and BYTEPATH had a really hard time getting any traction at all, both games released with 200 wishlists only, and for both of them most
playtesters didn't seem to really enjoy the game that much.

But then after release both of them saw some version of success that was way better than expected. This likely means that for these games I'm making
that don't really have good graphics, all they have to rely on for marketing is people actually playing and enjoying them. So my previous strategy of going for a playable demo
was likely right in this sense, although releasing an early broken demo is probably still not a good idea.

Either way, these are really good week two results.

### Reviews

As a very sort of off-topic aside, despite the increase in raw numbers of players, there was not a correspondent increase in number of reviews or bug reports. Until streamers/youtubers started playing it
the increase in reviews and forum usage was pretty consistent with the increase in purchases, but after that the relationship was broken completely.

This is probably due to the fact that before, most people buying the game were coming from the discovery queue, as mentioned in the post from the previous days. People using the discovery
queue are likely more used to using Steam features in general, and so they'll probably also review games and use the forums more frequently. Whereas people who are coming to the game from Twitch/YouTube are probably less accustomed
to leaving reviews or even using the forums for bug reports.

This has no implications on anything other than the fact that when trying to estimate sales based on review numbers I can probably get a better guess based on where most of the audience for the game is coming from.
If it's mostly coming from Twitch/YouTube then it's probably safe to increase the multiplier.

### Future

Now, one of the things I've been thinking a lot about these past few days is if I should keep updating the game or not. This game has performed way beyond my expectations so far and it seems like people really enjoy
playing it quite a lot more than I imagined.

On my lessons learned post I wrote that I thought SNKRX failed when it came to making a long game, that is, a game that lasts the player a long time. I think this assessment was both right and wrong. 

At its core SNKRX lacks any ability to keep people playing it for hundreds of hours, there's just not enough content and the game also isn't structured to support that kind of length.
On the other hand, the game's basic mechanics - building your snake and moving it around trying to not die - seems to be better at keeping people playing than I anticipated.

There's some clear evidence for the game's long potential based on daily player numbers too, especially compared to BYTEPATH:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/cMnXhDX.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/vgSLiBo.png" >}}

BYTEPATH had a fairly strong start but no retention at all, whereas SNKRX had a fairly weak start comparatively but seems to be retaining people a lot better.

Given that the failures of SNKRX in terms of its long potential are mostly due to content and structure, it seems like a good idea to try to fix that before moving on to the next game.
My idea is that adding a more traditional roguelite structure to it, probably something like Slay the Spire, would really improve the game. Adding some content updates (more units, classes, enemies, bosses, etc)
on top of that and a few more general QoL improvements that the game needs, and it would be in a really good spot.

I really wanted to just move on to another game but I know myself well enough to know that I'll regret not improving this game in these ways and seeing where it goes. I can probably add everything
I want in like 2 months, so even if nothing comes out of it it's still a fairly small amount of time "wasted" all things considered.

So this is what I'm probably going to do next and sadly this means that my "a game every 2 months" plan, as well as my engine refactor, have to be put on hold for a little while. >.<

## Day 20 (21/06/05)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BYTEPATH | 1825 | $3716 | 2059 |
| SNKRX | 6137 | $17290 | 3477 |

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/uJnJoqN.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/9KNDvB6.png" >}}

SNKRX is now doing 4.6~ times as well as BYTEPATH, making it go to about $55K over 3 years, equivalent to ~R$140K.
I'm not sure if this math even makes sense anymore as SNKRX has now surpassed BYTEPATH's lifetime revenue, which is about $12K.
It just seems like its own thing and the comparisons with BYTEPATH are probably not that helpful anymore.

One main reason for this is that SNKRX is a game that seems to last each individual longer, so whenever you get a bump in sales, that tends
to generate a much better result than it did for BYTEPATH due to those individuals enjoying the game more and thus spreading it via word of mouth. So the actual
projection over 3 years is likely way higher than the simple math above which is based on BYTEPATH's trajectory over its own 3 years.

Either way, these are extremely good results that go way beyond anything I ever expected. Now, let's go over what happened in these past 6 days!

### Player Numbers

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/zwMcMVX.png" >}}

Starting from the left of this graph, the bump provided by [RETROMATION's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxd52qyULE) video can be seen between May 30th and May 31st,
and this is the last thing that I talked about in the last update. After that, no new big YouTubers or streamers picked up the game, but two of the ones that picked it up earlier, 
[Dan Gheesling](https://www.twitch.tv/dangheesling) and [Wanderbot](https://www.youtube.com/user/wanderbots), made several videos about it and streamed the game again a couple of times.

Concurrent player numbers for SNKRX seem to follow a predictable pattern: at 16/17:00 of a given day there's a peak, then it drops a little, and there's another peak at 22/23/00:00.
It's useful to know this because then I can more easily notice any peak that's out place (which will generally mean a new big YouTuber/streamer is playing the game), as well as compare peaks of different days to see
if it's dropping and by how much.

For this past week SNKRX has been peaking at around ~150 concurrent each day, with an increase from May 31st to June 2nd (due to RETROMATION and others making their first videos about it) and a slight drop from then to June 5th.
This can be more easily seen on another useful graph:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/MXL7H4x.png" >}}

The game grows in daily active users to 1500 by June 1st, and then remains there with a very small drop starting to form. By itself this is good, because it means that the game is gaining users at around the same
pace that its losing them, and as long as this churn remains this slow it means that I have a better chance at keeping these numbers up and preventing the game from dying.

With this in mind, one positive of no one new and big picking up the game is that now that these numbers have stabilized (from June 1st to June 5th), I can actually test what effect *I* can have on them.

### Slay the Spire

So during this week I was preparing an update that's bigger than the ones before it because it also added some new content. These flat numbers provided a perfect opportunity to clearly see what effect such an update would have.
I've watched multiple GDC videos of different devs talking about their approach to updates:

{{< youtubestartend tmuy9fyNUjY 450 >}}

Here Chris mentions that PoE started with weekly updates and that for their game they noticed no effect. The main difference here is that their game at the time had 70K->10K concurrent users,
which is about 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than my game which has like 100. While what they learned (that 3 month, bigger updates were better) isn't useless to me, it's less useful at this stage of my game than this:

{{< youtubestartend j-5BaEoSU8Y 1895 >}}

The start of this talk (before the timestamp above) resonates with me pretty well. One of the reasons why I didn't really do much marketing for this game other than posting on reddit, Hacker News, and a few other social media
sites was because I've seen so many games that get results exactly like Slay the Spire got from all their effort that it just feels pointless.
These guys sent out 600 e-mails for the game they worked on for 2 years and got 0 responses! 

Coupled with my newfound detachment from necessarily having the things I do perform well online (which I described [here](https://www.a327ex.com/posts/lessons_second_game/#results)),
this resulted in me simply not caring enough to put in that amount of effort into marketing.

Rewatching this talk now and seeing that StS devs had a good experience with Keymailer
(there are also other similar services available now), I should probably consider using these to send out a few keys to more streamers and YouTubers,
given that they have a pretty good and consistent effect on the game's player numbers, and they're probably more likely to pick it up now that it has lots of reviews and most of them are positive.

In any case, I linked the section where Casey talks about weekly updates because it's a good example of a game that started out slow but had good retention, had weekly patches, and grew substantially.
From a quick glance at how much other developers in similar tags update their games, most devs seem to be slower than one sizable patch a week, and while this isn't a competition, it means
that if I can keep this pace up and have good patches every week, chances are players will really like it above most other games, and that kind of good will has a way of generating good things in the long run.

### Update

So going into this week this was my thought process. I worked on the update and finished it in 3-4 days, and then [released it](https://steamcommunity.com/games/915310/announcements/detail/3042724733968112646)
Friday night/Saturday morning. I tried to make sure that everything I did was communicated well and also shared my plan for weekly updates as well as a bigger update 2-3 months from now.

I'm writing this 1 day after releasing it, so I have the effects of the immediate day after:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/a21EIMK.png" >}}

The picture above shows the most recent 3 days, with the last being the day after the update. While previous days were peaking at 150 concurrents, update day peaked at around 200, and the lows were also higher
than previous days. Similarly, the number of daily active users saw an increase:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/xgXPsMG.png" >}}

While before DAU was at 1500, update day brought it up to 1800! Finally, one last piece of data:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/9KNDvB6.png" >}}

Here it's visible that the daily number of sales didn't increase at all, unlike when new YouTubers/streamers made videos about it. This means that this particular increase in player numbers was *entirely*
due to the update, meaning that I did in fact get a pretty good idea of how such an update affects player numbers, and it seems to be about a 20-25% increase.

Going into the following days I'll try to see how the numbers drop to see how long this increase lasts, but if it lasts 1 week or more then that would be amazing because it would mean that as long
as I keep releasing updates the numbers won't go down, or will go down very slowly.

And the more important thing is that this property probably holds if the game grows, meaning, if the game has 1000 DAU or 10000 DAU, an update should have a 20-25% increase regardless.
These are very optimistic results and I'm looking forward to how it develops.

### Productivity

One thing I've noticed with doing updates for this game for about 2 weeks is that I'm way more productive now than I was when I was working on it before release.

I don't know if this is because the game is succeeding and it gave me an extra productivity boost or if it's because it's easier to work on a project that's already established, but it feels really good
to be able to do so much with a comparatively way lower amount of effort spent.

I mentioned in the previous update that I'd have to give up doing my engine refactor to keep working on this game, but at this point I'm considering doing both things at the same time simply because I feel like
I can handle the workload required. 

The big update I'm planning to release 2-3 months from now is substantial enough that it's basically like rewriting the game, so it makes sense to also redo the parts of the engine that I know need to be redone.
I may regret this decision but this is what I'm leaning towards right now.

## Day 23 (21/06/08)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SNKRX | 10249 | $29535 | 4797 |

### Northernlion

[Northernlion played SNKRX](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1048876762) 2 days ago on stream and then [uploaded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg_zXXW7oT0) about it yesterday to YouTube.
I think NL is probably the best YouTuber/streamer who could have played the game because he's the biggest that generally plays roguelites and that ends up having a very focused effect on player numbers and sales.

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/fzbIejd.png" >}}

From June 7th to 8th the peak when he streamed it is visible, and that was a peak of around 400 concurrents. At the end of June 8th there's the YouTube video peak, which was higher than the Twitch one by a substantial amount.
Unfortunately Steam went down right as that was happening so the actual peak wasn't captured in this graph, but based on when I was looking at it on the Steamworks app it was around 600:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/TrSbnma.png" >}}

So here we have a pretty good and clean example of someone's effect on the game from both platforms, and it seems like YouTube is generally the better one.
It could be argued that because NL has been on YouTube the longest that will naturally be the most valuable one, but this property seems to hold regardless of who the person is. 

Based on previous YouTubers/streamers playing the game, it seems that YouTube videos just lead to more consistent results with a decline that's spread out over time,
while streams have a sharp increase when the streamer is playing it, but also a sharp decline when the streamer stops. In any case:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/4yc9IOK.png" >}}

Daily active users also increased substantially. Stream took DAU from 1800 to 2200, and YouTube seems to have taken it to almost 3000.

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/6hbqOlF.png" >}}

Sales also increased similarly, with the stream taking it from 500 to 1100, and YouTube taking it to 2500.

It's also unknown how long it will take for the game to decline to previous levels from here, but based on previous similar bumps,
should no other big YouTuber/streamer pick up the game, it should take a week for a decline to start to form from these new heights
and then I'd assume a more general decline follows from there.

### Productivity

On an unrelated note, I mentioned in the previous post that I was more productive now than before releasing the game.

I thought more about this and I think what's actually happening is that I'm not actually more productive, but I feel more productive.
The reason is that now, each thing that I implement in the game has an actual value attached to it, whereas before this wasn't the case.

For instance, fixing a bug now feels high value because I know that someone reported that bug and I'm making the game better for them, but also because I know that if 1 person
reported a bug it means at least like 10 have also been affected by it before. And I know that if 5 people have reported a bug in the span of an hour, it's a bug that's literally affecting
everyone, so fixing it feels very high value, despite most bug fixes taking like 5 minutes at most.

This must one of the reasons why devs like Early Access and just generally having this feedback loop between dev and player so much.
It just feels a lot better than developing the game mostly on your own.


## Day 31 (21/06/16)

| Game | Units Sold | Total Revenue | Wishlists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SNKRX | 32046 | $94216 | 9391 |

### Northernlion

NL played the game multiple times last week and posted multiple videos to his YouTube channel as well. Coupled with other YouTubers and streamers who also played it and posted more videos, this resulted
in an absolutely massive increase in player numbers and sales.

Concurrents peaked at 1223 on Sunday, June 13th, which was both after Friday's update and after NL released 2 weekend videos on the game:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/7o6mpHB.png" >}}

Peak DAU was on the next day at slightly over 10K users:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/Y5GQpP4.png" >}}

Peak sales were on June 9th at 3.7K, which was the day when NL released the first video of the game on his channel:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/qmw27o9.png" >}}

At around that day the game was also at the top of Steamcharts's trending games list:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/QhI8CoQ.png" >}}

So here we can see the full effect of what a big YouTuber constantly releasing videos on a game can do. If NL had only released 1 video on the game
it likely would have peaked at slightly higher numbers than what I mentioned on day 23, but since it happened multiple times for an entire week it led to a gradual increase
that doubled or tripled those initial values.

I'm not sure if NL releasing even more videos will lead to further increases because at some point most of his audience that's interested will already have bought the game,
but then there's also a secondary effect where NL playing it also convinces more streamers/YouTubers to play it, which leads to even more people trying it out and so on. That effect is harder/impossible
to measure though.

### New and trending

Since the game released I've been checking both Steam's [roguelites](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Roguelite/) and [deckbuilding](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Deckbuilding/) pages:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/vkLzUyi.png" >}}

SNKRX has been at the top of both of these tags (as well as others I'd assume) since it released and I've always wondered how Valve's algorithm works and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on it now.

Before, I thought it mostly cared about how much money it was making Valve per view, so that, should everything remain equal, more expensive games would have an advantage. This would make sense because
these are essentially ad spots, and if Valve wants to maximize their money made per ad view, if two games have the same conversion numbers, it's reasonable to put the more expensive game there. This was also
roughly how it was explained in this video, so I assumed it was mostly correct:

{{< youtube fUikS5ojUSk >}}

And maybe this was more right 5 years ago, but now it seems slightly different. I think the money made per view thing still matters, but given how my (relatively cheap) game has gone up and down on this list over this month
I'm pretty convinced now that the *amount of time people are playing the game for* matters A LOT. And it would make sense, because I never knew how Valve handled free games, and those games show up on new and trending lists often.

Essentially, whenever the game got a higher number of concurrent players it would go up on the list, and whenever it got a lower number of concurrent players it would go down. Because it's a new and trending list there's also
an age effect going on, but it seems that so far SNKRX has been able to offset the age parameter due to how much it's growing, which means it gets to stays there for a while.

I also think that, for these tag pages especially, there's a heavy effect based on if the people playing the game generally also play games on that tag. So if most of the audience playing SNKRX mostly plays other
games with the roguelite tag, then SNKRX will place better on the roguelite new and trending list.

Overall I'm not sure what the impact of those lists for SNKRX is, because it seems like most visits to the game are still coming from the discovery queue:

{{< figure src="https://i.imgur.com/RDWLnYS.png" >}}

Quite a lot of impressions from these tag pages but not that many visits. This is likely due to the fact that the game looks bad though. And also these are sort of secondary lists,
and I don't think SNKRX has done well enough to be on the main page new and trending, as that seems to be the one that can really drive sales.

Overall SNKRX's performance on Steam seems to be OK, but if not for YouTubers I think the game would have "died" quite a while ago as Steam's traffic by itself doesn't seem to be able to drive player numbers up significantly,
and this is likely due to

### Graphics and retention

A better game would have been able to take 1 week of NL exposure and turn it into a positive feedback loop where the YouTuber playing it gives it a better position on Steam, which makes more people play it, which makes more
YouTubers play it, which gives it a better position on Steam, and so on.

This happened to this game to some extent, but not like I've seen that it can happen to other games. And this is likely due to the two main problems that the game has: graphics and retention.

Visually the game looks unnatractive to most people, and I know this for a fact because before release it was basically impossible to get anyone to care about it, which generally means that it looks like garbage.
I'm not an artist so I'm fine with that, but if the game is to perform better then it simply needs a graphical update to make it look like a proper game. This is something I'm working on, and especially now that the game
has done so well it shouldn't be hard to find someone who can make it look good.

However, I think that graphics are a secondary problem, and the main one is retention:

As it is, this game is really good at keeping people playing for 1-2 weeks maybe? But after they've explored enough there's a pretty consistent drop off that so far has only not been reflected in player numbers
because new, bigger YouTubers keep playing it every week. Once that new influx of people stops though, the game will experience an overall drop in all numbers as people simply stop playing it.

Most good roguelites that people play for hundreds of hours have much better retention than the numbers above (although I haven't been able to compare with anyone to know for sure),
so I think this is the main problem that needs to be solved.

I think I mentioned it before, but I intend on solving it by turning the game into a more "traditional roguelite", with a game mode that plays like a normal roguelite run and less like the arcade game that it is now.
On top of that there can also be unlocks, more achievements, daily challenges, etc. Basically everything you'd expect from a normal roguelite.

Doing all this takes time though, and so far I haven't been able to focus on this higher level goal because

### Weekly updates

I've been doing somewhat meaty weekly updates for the game for about 3 weeks now, and as the Slay the Spire devs said in the GDC talk I linked above, these updates
are, in fact, pretty paralyzing. It's very hard to focus on anything else when you have to deliver something sizable every week.

I'm happy with how it's going so far and I'm not overworking myself, but I think it's inevitable that eventually, as StS devs said, some weekly updates will have to be
somewhat underwhelming so I can focus on actually doing the longer term work that needs to be done to make the game better.

Overall though it seems like people are really enjoying the updates so I'll probably try to keep them with this kind of scope for a few more weeks at least.
